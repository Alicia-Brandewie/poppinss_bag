# Poppins's Bag
When you're planning an event, not only do you have to keep track of all the items you need but you also need to remember where in you stored them. 

Kudos to you if you remeber where you stashed the disco ball punch bowl after last New Year's Eve celebration, but I've already forgotten which cranny of my house it's in by January 5th.  

Poppins's Bag to the rescue: a jolly app to help catalog all of your items and events, inspired by the whimsical nanny's limitless-capacity bag!  Styled after the dandy suit stripes of the spry chimney sweep friend, it'll make your planning that much easier -- indubitably! 

But wait! The neighbor asked to borrow the disco ball punch bowl, so maybe it's at their house?  Poppin's bag to the rescue again because you can interact with other Hosts and their catalog of items as well (more functionality in the community are under construction)! 

## Getting Started 

***Like a chalk drawing on a London sidewalk, [jump into Poppins's Bag here].***

[jump into Poppins's Bag here]: https://poppinss-bag-8009da65f7ed.herokuapp.com/


Click through "Sign Up" to create your account if it's your first time, or "Sign in" to rummage around again. 

Your bag will start out empty, so click on "Add item" to catalog your first item. Add as many as you'd like, and they'll all appear on the "My Bag" page. Need to see or change the details of an item? Click on it from the "My Bag" catalog view to reveal more information about an item, and then click through "Edit this item".  On the "Edit" page, you can update details or delete the item. 

Now that the item's compartment is no longer echoingly-empty, pop on over to the "My Events" page. Here you can click on "Add event" to create an event -- and look! You can peruse all of your bag's items on the drop down menu to add to you event (note: save function under construction). Again, need to see or change the details of an event? Click on it from the "My Events" calendar view to reveal more information about an event, and then click through "Edit this event".  On the "Edit" page, you can update details or delete the event. 

Don't have a popup tent for the next shindig? Head over to "Hosts" to see the community of other folks using Poppins's Bag. Click on a user's name to see what's in their bag.
